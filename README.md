# Just Another Space Shooter

First project using C++ for university. <br>
Everything was made by one person. (Background was made using a [generator](https://deep-fold.itch.io/space-background-generator)) <br>
Aseprite for 2D art and used Visual Studio 2022 to write in C++.

The game has 3 levels, in the first one the player has to shoot down 10 meteors. <br>
The player can move by WASD, shoot by space and rotate in the direction of the mouse. <br>
The next level has a few enemies that move left-right in a loop and shoot down. <br>
Next level starts after destroying all enemies. <br>
The last level has enemies that follow player and shoot in its direction. <br>
The game is completed after shooting down all enemies. <br>
The player can restart the game with R when game over screen is visible. <br>

It leaves room for many features to be implemented, like adding some upgrades or making different enemies and their patterns.
